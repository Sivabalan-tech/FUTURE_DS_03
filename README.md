# 📊 COLLEGE EVENT FEEDBACK ANALYSIS

## 📝 Overview
This project analyzes **text and rating-based feedback** submitted by students after attending campus events such as tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities.  
Using **simulated or real Google Forms data (CSV)**, we apply basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and data visualization to uncover patterns in satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare feedback data (from Google Form exports).
- Analyze ratings (1–5 scale) to detect patterns of satisfaction.
- Use NLP sentiment analysis to classify comments as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.
- Visualize results with **bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds**.
- Suggest actionable improvements for future events.
